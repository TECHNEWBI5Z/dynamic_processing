Dynamic Processing in Databricks Notebooks

Overview

This repository provides examples of dynamic processing in Databricks notebooks, enabling flexible, scalable, and automated data workflows. You’ll find techniques to optimize resource usage, handle various data types, and adapt to changing pipeline conditions.

Key Techniques

	•	Dynamic Input: Use Databricks widgets to capture user input and control notebook execution.
	•	Conditional Execution: Run specific code blocks based on runtime conditions.
	•	Dynamic Data Loading: Load datasets or apply transformations based on parameters.
	•	Looping & Task Control: Dynamically iterate and control tasks within your notebook.
	•	Dynamic SQL: Construct and execute SQL queries on-the-fly.
	•	Real-Time Processing: Handle streaming data with Spark Structured Streaming.
	•	Dynamic Scaling: Adjust cluster resources based on workload requirements.


Getting Started

	1.	Clone the repository:
	2.	Import the notebooks into your Databricks workspace.
	3.	Experiment with the provided examples and adapt them to your needs.
